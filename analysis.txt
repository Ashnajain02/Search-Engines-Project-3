ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:

1. 
    Average length of a scene: 1199.5561497326203 ~ 1200 words
    Shortest scene: antony_and_cleopatra:2.8
    Longest scene: loves_labors_lost:4.1
    Shortest play: macbeth
    Longest play: hamlet

2. 
    Overall counts such as longest/shortest counts could be misleading features because, we know that the length of a scene has no influence on the content of a scene.
    This means that using count as a feature is not optimal because there is no relationship between them.
    We could fix this by, storing the word counts of individual words. By doing this, we can see if 2 document share similar context by whether or not they have high appearances of a same word. 

3. 
    The queries that took the longest was query-6
    The words in query-6 are extremly common words that appear very often in the english language. 
    This means that the there are a lot of instances of the word in the inverted index, which means that the query process has to parse through a lot of 
    locations, requiring more time.
